## VAD and PEB

VAD is Virtual Address Descriptor and PEB is Process Environment Block. Vad lives in the kernel memory and PEB lives in the process memory.

VADs (Virtual Address Descriptors) are used by the memory manager to track ALL memory allocated on the system. Malware and rootkits can hide from a lot of different OS components, but hiding from the memory manager is unwise. If it canâ€™t see your memory, it will give it away!
