#Application_Execution 
We often see adversaries using the task scheduler to execute binaries—arbitrary or native (albeit relocated)—from user-writable directories like `appdata/roaming`. This is ostensibly an effort to schedule the execution of code from directories that can be manipulated by other users, regardless of their privilege level. Another common behavior involves leveraging scheduled tasks to open the [Windows Command Shell](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/windows-command-shell/), generally in an effort to establish persistence or otherwise call on the command shell’s versatility to execute code or launch other system binaries. Adversaries also abuse scheduled tasks to call on `regsvr32.exe` to download and execute a DLL, a behavior that [we’ve previously associated with crimeware like Qbot](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/).

All tasks currently registered to a Windows machine are represented by a set of registry keys and values in the `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache` tree
